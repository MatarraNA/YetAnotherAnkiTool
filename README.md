# Welcome to YetAnotherAnkiTool

YetAnotherAnkiTool is a simple utility that allows you to quickly add Images and Audio to your Anki cards. It works by recording Audio and Screenshots on an interval, and when it detects a new Anki card has been added to your deck, it will pop up allowing you to select a screenshot + audio to add to your card.

When a card is detected, it will pause capturing and show up under "Latest Anki Card". It will allow you to select the screenshot you'd like to use, as well as the start + end offset for the recorded audio you'd like to save.

You can double click an image here to enlarge it, and left clicking on the slider sets the "Start Offset", with right click setting the "End Offset".
